📈 RetailSense
Predictive Decision Support for Retail Merchandising & Inventory Planning
🧠 In One Sentence

RetailSense helps retail chains understand why stores perform differently and what operational changes will improve sales.

🚩 The Problem

Retail teams frequently face situations like:

Same product → different performance across outlets

No clarity whether pricing, visibility, or location caused it

Merchandising decisions based on intuition

BI dashboards showing what happened but not what to change

Store managers don’t need more charts.
They need answers to:

“What should we change tomorrow morning in the store?”

🎯 Product Goal

Turn raw retail data into operational actions:

Raw Data → Signals → Decision → Store Action


Instead of analytics reporting, RetailSense focuses on decision support.

🧩 What Decisions This Supports

Assortment planning

Pricing adjustments

Shelf visibility optimization

Outlet-level stocking strategy

🏗 Product Principles
Principle	Why it matters
Interpretability over complexity	Users must trust outputs
Decisions, not dashboards	Output must trigger action
Robust across store types	Works for all outlet categories
Assistive intelligence	Supports planners, doesn’t replace them

Operational Recommendation


The system intentionally separates:

Prediction ≠ Recommendation

🔍 Key Insights Observed

Medium stores can outperform large stores in total sales

Item visibility strongly impacts outlet sales

Category mix affects performance more than pricing alone

Outlet characteristics influence outcomes as much as product attributes

This explains why universal pricing or stocking strategies fail.

🧪 What This Case Study Demonstrates

This is not a machine learning project — it is a product thinking exercise showing:

framing a data problem into an operational workflow

converting predictions into user decisions

designing for trust & interpretability

building confidence in system recommendations
