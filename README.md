## Predictive Decision Support for Retail Merchandising & Inventory Planning

---

## 🧠 One-Line Summary
RetailSense helps retail chains understand **why stores perform differently** and what operational changes will improve sales.

---

## 🚩 The Problem

Retail teams frequently encounter:

- The same product performing differently across outlets
- No clarity whether pricing, visibility, or location caused it
- Merchandising decisions based on intuition
- BI dashboards showing *what happened* but not *what to change*

Store managers don’t need more charts.

They need answers to:

> **What should we change tomorrow morning in the store?**

---

## 🎯 Product Goal

Turn raw retail data into operational actions:


RetailSense focuses on **decision support**, not analytics reporting.

---

## 🧩 Supported Decisions

- Assortment planning
- Pricing adjustments
- Shelf visibility optimization
- Outlet-level stocking strategy

## 🏗 Product Principles

| Principle | Why it matters |
|--------|------|
| Interpretability over complexity | Users must trust outputs |
| Decisions, not dashboards | Output must trigger action |
| Robust across store types | Works for all outlet categories |
| Assistive intelligence | Supports planners, doesn’t replace them |

---

## 🔍 Key Insights Observed

- Medium stores can outperform large stores in total sales
- Item visibility strongly impacts outlet sales
- Category mix affects performance more than pricing alone
- Outlet characteristics influence outcomes as much as product attributes

These explain why universal pricing or stocking strategies often fail.

## 🧪 What This Case Study Demonstrates

This is not a machine learning project.  
It demonstrates product thinking:

- framing a data problem into an operational workflow
- converting predictions into user decisions
- designing for trust & interpretability
- enabling real-world actionability

## 🚀 If Built As A Real Product

Planned next steps:

- Store recommendation UI
- Scenario simulation (“If visibility increases?”)
- Confidence bands for planners
- Inventory system integration
